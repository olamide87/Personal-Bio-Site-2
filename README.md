# Personal Bio Site

## Description
This project exists to showcase my developer portfolio and projects I have worked on during the course of learning to code. 

I built the site using a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, and vanilla Javascript, but also utilized Firebase to store project data and made an Axios API call to read the project data. Each project was selected from group and individual assignments from the full stack developer program I participated in through Nashviille Software School.
